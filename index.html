            <p class="hyper">I am 18 years old as of making this portfolio and am a student at Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam
                situated in
                the Netherlands. I study software development and am training in with HTML, CSS and JS. Whilst also
                dipping my toes in PHP.
                My goal is to be able make an adequate website that fulfills any desires a client or a I may have. I wish
                to become better in designing and working with back-end coding.

        <div class="mainLine">
            <p class="hyper">I am a very dedicated gamer, considering I am playing on a daily basis. I play a lot of
                Heart of Iron IV, which is a strategy game, Dead by Daylight and Phasmaphobia.
                Of course only playing wouldn't be very healthy. Which is why i am also trying to modeling. I currently
                have made: a spitfire, a panzer II and still building a Gneisenau battlecruiser.
                Apart from playing video games and building models, i also like video editing. I am using Davinci
                Resolve for most of my editing and am learning new things every time i get a chance to edit.

            <p class="hyper">Now, I am well known amongst my friends and family that i am a history nerd. I know a lot
                of different battles fought and I know what kind of strategies different generals used to gain the upper
                hand.
                I mostly specify in the time period of 1933 to 1945 however. From the sands of Africa, to the Seas of
                Asia. From the Beaches of the western front, to the mountains of the eastern front.
                I enjoy research that period because you can always learn more. It was a world war after all. Of course
                I also have a taste in music. Although it is very diverse. My favorite band is sabaton,
                I like their way of teaching history in the form of music and their music bangs. My favorite song is
                1812 overture (no, this is not a joke).

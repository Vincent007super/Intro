Did take a while before this project had a README file, better late than never.

This project has been made with a whole lot of blood, toil, tears and sweat. The website has been designed and coded by myself. 
But I was not alone in this project, below are the people who helped me in designing this website:
- Ira Nathan
- Evy larmit
- Remco van Adrichem

This website has been made with multiple techniques, including:
- The Javascript library three.js
- WebGL
- Simplex noise
- Blender
